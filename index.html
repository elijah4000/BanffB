    <h2>Transit Options once arrived in banff</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Roam Transit</strong>
            <p>25 dollars for a 3 day pass pretty similar to our bus system the earliest buses has fewer different routes
            earliest bus comes at 7 am and latest at 10pm but changes from route to
            route. And they come every 20 minutes to every hour depends on the route</p>
            <a href="https://roamtransit.com/" target="_blank">Roam Transit Website</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Parks Canada Shuttle</strong>
            <p>Included with the 3 day roam ticket probably not running when well be there tho</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Renting a bike</strong>
            <p> Not sure how fond you guys would be about biking but i think this
            is a good idea is pretty expensive tho 20-40 for a day but we can get
            discounts for multiday rentals</p>

            <strong>HI Banff Alpine Centre</strong>
            <p>$40–$50 per night i think we could have one or two nights in a hostel also and oppourtunity to
                meet other budget travellers <br>
            Kitchen and wifi near hikes we may do (Sulphur and Tunnel) easily accesed by roam transit</p>

        <li>
            <strong>Samesun Banff</strong>
            <p>Similar cost comes with free breakfast. Also have a bar lol legal
            drinking age in alberta is 18. Located in the main touristy area of banff
            take it as a positive or negative. The main bonus here tho is it could be
            easy to meet other travellers although im not sure how social we really are.</p>

<section id="itinerary">
    <h2>Sample Itinerary( A long one we could do less days)</h2>
    <ul>
         <li><strong>Day 1 </strong>: We get to the airport whether it be someone we know drive us or uber then we take our prebooked poparide
            from yyc to banff check in at our hostel or campsite.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 2 </strong>: Hike Sulphur Mountain not a full day hike so after we could go in town
             and for example go to a hot Spring anywhere from 10-25 dollars each
            although i dont want to add too many extra fees.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 3 </strong>: Hike Johnston Canyon to Ink Pots trail (day long hike)</li>
        <li><strong>Day 4 </strong>: Hike Cascade Amphitheatre, explore Banff town(Could also take a rest day during this section
            not sure how much you guys want to explore the touristy part of town but im down)
            Also could just chill at a place like lake louise</li>
        <li><strong>Day 5 </strong>: Hike Lake Minnewanka Lakeside Trail.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 6 </strong>: Travel back to Calgary Airport.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So after 175-300 dollar flight i would be ready for at least 400 dollars to 700 at most depeding how many things we want to do
    <br> Also another thing we could do is get an iterary from a group of strangers on facebook because there are groups for things like this
    but the things that we better book early is plane ticket, hostel/campsite and transit in that order.</p>
